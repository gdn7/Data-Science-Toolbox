### TensorFlow
This folder contains tensorflow tutorials collected from O'Reily book Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow. Many deprecated warnings are expected, since the book is quite old.

Complementary notes are added to aid comprehension. The contents are used as study notes, not production-grade codes.
