# Memcached is an open source, high-performance, distributed memory object caching system.

# At Airbnb, many applications use Memcached, but we suspect they are not using it efficiently. This means that there may be some keys or groups of keys that have very low cache hit rates.

# Weâ€™d like to do some analysis to find these groups of keys and their hit rates.

# Instructions

# Based on the provided data file, calculate the hit rates per key or group of key.

# * The standard input of your program will be the data file.
# * The standard output of your program will be a set of lines with <key>\t<hit rate> pairs.

# Definitions

# * cache hit: the requested key exists in the cache. The associated value is returned to the client.
# * cache miss: the requested key does NOT exist in the cache.
# * hit rate:
#     * the percentage of get requests that result in cache hits.
#     * in the example traffic dump below, the user key group has a 100% hit rate (2 of 2), while the listing key group has a 0% hit rate (0 of 2).

# * Each line is tab-delimited with columns as described below.
# * There may be whitespaces at the beginning and the end of each line.
# * Column Definitions:
#     * conn_id:
#         * an integer identifying the connection the request/response was sent/received on.
#     * magic:
#         * a string identifying whether this is a request or response.
#         * possible values: req and resp.
#     * opcode:
#         * a string identifying the operation
#         * possible values:
#             * set, a set operation
#             * get, a get operation
#             * getkq, a multi-get operation. The client sends a number of getkq operations specifying what keys to retrieve. The server does not initially respond. Upon the next noop request, the server returns all the queued responses.
#             * noop, signal the end of a multi-get request.
#     * status:
#         * a string set only on responses
#         * possible values:
#             * ok for a successful set or a cache hit on get
#             * nokey for a cache miss on get.
#     * key:
#         * a string representing the cache key. A key group is a set of keys sharing the same prefix. Eg., listing_1 and listing_2 are both part of the listing key group.
