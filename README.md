## Data Science Toolbox
Examples and illustration of basic statistic concepts, probability distribution, Monte Carlo simulation, preprocessing and visualization techniques, and statistical testing.

### Directory
This repo is divided into multiple sections. Each section focuses on a group of concept, operation, or data science toolkit. A brief summary is presented below (in alphabetical order):
* **[algorithm](./algorithm)**: rudimentary algorithm and data structure, using LeetCode problems for practice. Solutions are provided and commented. Problems are grouped by subjects (BFS, DFS, tree etc.).
* **[case_study](./case_study)**: small datasets that exemplifies regression/classification workflow, from data cleaning to feature engineering, modeling, training, evaluation etc.
* **[cheatsheet](./cheatsheet)**: useful derivations of commonly used formula, for future review.
* **[data_structure](./data_structure)**: standalone data structure overview in Python (union-find, trie etc.).
* **[distribution](./distribution)**: common probability distribution, PDF, CDF, simulation methods.
* **[handy_syntax](./handy_syntax)**: Python tricks that are often useful but hard to memorize.
* **[keras](./keras)**: high level tensorflow API. Basic use cases.
* **[models](./models)**: more in-depth study of specific ML models.
* **[preprocessing](./preprocessing)**: data cleaning, smoothing, pipelining etc.
* **[simulation](./simulation)**: interesting simulation experiments for brain exercise.
* **[statistic_test](./statistic_test)**: a catalogue of commonly used statistical tests and implementation in Python.
* **[tensorflow](./tensorflow)**: plain tensorflow for deep learning tasks.
* **[training](./training)**: tricks to speed up training tensorflow models.
* **[unittest](./unittest)**: standard protocols for Python unit tests.
* **[unix](./unix)**: keeping track of Python environments and for easy restoration.
* **[visualization](./visualization)**: example use case of matplotlib, plotly, ggplot, and animation.
